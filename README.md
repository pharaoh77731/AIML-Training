# AIML-Training
I learnt these things in Introductory course training in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and Libraries used during this traing in it are listed below:-
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Scikit-learn
4. Matplotlib
5. OpenCV-python
6. Scikit-image
7. TensorFlow
8. SpeechRecognition and Pyaudio
9. cmake and FaceRecognition
10. Flask and nltk
11. Pygame

Using above libraries I've learnt some concepts which are also listed below:-
1. Image and Video Reading 
2. Face Detection and Face recognition
3. Speech Recognition
4. Chatbot
5. Speech-to-Text converters
6. Linear, Multiple, and Polynomial Regression
7. Random Forests and Logistic Regression
8. K Nearest Neighbour (KNN)
9. Decision Trees
10. Deep Learning concepts like Neural Neetworking {Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)}
11.Object Recognition Usng EFFICIENTNET provided by CNN

That's all.
